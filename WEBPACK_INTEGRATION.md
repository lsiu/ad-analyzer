# Webpack Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate webpack into the Ad Highlighter Chrome Extension and split the content.js file into logical components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Structure
- Created a new `js/` directory for source files
- Created a `js/modules/` directory for individual modules
- Organized existing code into modular components
- Set up webpack build system with appropriate configurations

### 2. Module Organization
The original `content.js` file was split into the following logical modules:

- `adSelectors.js` - Contains all ad selector patterns
- `adVerification.js` - Functions to verify if elements are actually ads
- `adHighlighter.js` - Core ad highlighting functionality
- `adScheduler.js` - Timing and scheduling for periodic ad detection
- `messaging.js` - Chrome extension message handling
- `popupHandler.js` - Popup UI interaction handling

### 3. Entry Points
- `js/content.js` - Main content script entry point that imports and uses modules
- `js/popup.js` - Popup script entry point

### 4. Webpack Configuration
- Created base webpack configuration (`webpack.config.js`)
- Created development configuration (`webpack.dev.js`) with proper source map settings
- Created production configuration (`webpack.prod.js`) with source map generation
- Configured appropriate output settings for Chrome extensions

### 5. Build Process
- Added npm scripts for building, development, and packaging
- Created a build script to copy necessary files to the `dist/` directory
- Added a packaging script to create a zip file for distribution

### 6. Source Maps
- Configured both development and production builds to generate source maps
- Ensured the `npm run watch` command also generates source maps for debugging
- Source maps are properly linked to enable debugging in Chrome DevTools

### 7. Updated Manifest
- Modified `manifest.json` to reference bundled files in the `dist/` directory
- Updated `popup.html` and `test-trade-desk.html` to reference bundled JavaScript files

## Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Code is now organized into logical, reusable components
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, test, and modify individual pieces
3. **Build Optimization**: Webpack provides minification and optimization
4. **Development Workflow**: Better development experience with source maps and watch mode
5. **Debugging**: Source maps enable proper debugging in Chrome DevTools
6. **Future Extensibility**: Easier to add new features and functionality

## Usage

To build the extension:
```bash
npm run build
```

To develop with automatic rebuilding:
```bash
npm run watch
```

To package for distribution:
```bash
npm run package
```

The built extension files are located in the `dist/` directory and can be loaded directly into Chrome.

## Debugging

Source maps are now properly generated for both development and production builds. When debugging the content script in Chrome DevTools, you should be able to see the original source files rather than the bundled code. This makes it much easier to set breakpoints and debug the extension.

# Icons for Chrome Extension

This directory contains both SVG and PNG icon files for the Chrome extension:

- icon16.svg / icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.svg / icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.svg / icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons are used in the Chrome Extensions interface and toolbar.

The icons feature a white square with a red border and the letters "AD" in red, representing the ad highlighting functionality.

The PNG files are referenced in the manifest.json file for use by the extension.
